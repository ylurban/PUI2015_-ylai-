### Homework 3
In homework 3 part 3, we use citibike data to look into the seasonal change of trip duration. Citibike data shows that there is a relatively low bike useage during winter time. It is presumed that many subscribers follow a pattern in trip duration, such as grocery shopping or commuting. However, it is not clear that wether there is a seasonal dynamic in such usage pattern. In this research, we look into citibike data generated by subscribers in summer months (July and August, 2015) and winter months (January and Febuary, 2015), in order to compare the seasonal difference in trip duration generated by subscribers.

In this research, we question if there is a significant difference between the mean of trip duration in summer months and winter months by subscribers. To test H0: mu1 - mu2 = 0 against Ha: mu1 - mu2 not eaqual zero.

We define the null hypothesis as: There is no difference in the average trip duration of subscribers in summer months as compared to the winter months. Significance level Î±=0.05.

### Responsibility in Collaboration 
In this collaboration I worked on development of the null hypothesis and the code, including data reading, restrucutring, cleanning (to exclude trip duration outliers), data plotting, and hypothesis testing (z-score testing and t-statistics).
Part of the code development were through co-working by me (Yuan Lai) and Sachin Verma.
