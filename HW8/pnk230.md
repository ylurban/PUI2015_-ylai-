Hi. I really like the topic you chose for data visualization. The code for plotting is clear and precise. 
One suggestion from me would be: when conducting a comparison via data visuzalitonation, it's better to NOT plot your data on a third dimension. 
Introducing the third dimension will weaken the comparison graphically and it might cause visual confusion.
