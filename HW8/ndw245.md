Hello! The visualization is interesting and your code is clear and well writen. 
The figure is very easy to read with nice graphic and profer figure size and font size. 

One suggestion is to clarify the research interest of your data visuzaltion: what do you want to show by this visualization? 
Do you want to show the the team with more deviated playing time distribution or some other comparison through multiple teams?
