This folder contains two assignments for PUI homework 5, majorly focusing on geo-data reading, data merging, fit and plot data, and various regression models.
The first one is data analysis in buidling energy usage by using PLUTO data and LL84 data. 
The second one is data analysis in income equality by gender and race. 

I worked on this homework by myself, though some help and dicussion with Yuxiang Zhang, Yuning Liu and Diogo Sponchiado.
