Homework 4 contains 3 assignments including testing of distributions using citibike data. 
In assignment 1, we used KS test to test the correlation of users' age with gender and time of citibike data. 
In assignemnt 2, we tested the difference between a Binomial/Poisson distribution and a Gaussian distribution as you change the parameters of the Binomial/Poisson.
In the third part, we fit the citibike data to various distributions and use KS and AD score to test our null hypothesis. H0 = citibike related distribution is same as the distribution to fit. 

I have worked on the code development by myself with some peers'(Xia Wang and Sachin Verma) help regarding me specific coding and git bash question.
